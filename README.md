# Floyd-Warshall with MPI
All Pairs Shortest Paths problem solved with an MPI-based implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

This software aims to benchmark the FW algorithm when using the Message Passing Interface for distributed computing.
Once the instance size (i.e. the number of nodes) is set via command line argument, a random graph will be generated, and the FW will be executed.
